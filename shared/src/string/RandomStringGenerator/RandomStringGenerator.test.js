quote
  Your limitation â€” itâ€™s only your imagination
  Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you
  Sometimes later becomes never. Do it now
  Great things never come from comfort zones
  Dream it. Wish it. Do it.
  Success doesnâ€™t just find you. You have to go out and get it.
  The harder you work for something, the greater youâ€™ll feel when you achieve it.
  Dream bigger. Do bigger.
